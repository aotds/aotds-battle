- bogey movements


 - have redactor take more than one action
 make src/store/bogeys/reducer.test.ts pass
- make the src/store/**/*.test.ts tests pass
 cat tests.json | env NODE_PATH=node_modules fx .testResults 'fp.filter({status: "failed"})' "fp.map('name')"
- move away from typesafe-actions and to ts-actions
- move away from Reaction for Redactor

configure vim  for the make doign a dts -p ./tsconfig.json

- sample_game, a little further
    - record internal damage (on drive)
        - make src/store/bogey/reducer.test.ts
            then: I changed internal_damage to internal_damage_check
            inflate_bogey
