# AotDS, captain log 9: Immer onto something?

Good gracious, it's been quite a while since I've touched this pet project, hasn't it? Well, I'm back. And, predictively, the first thing I did when returning was to decide to
fall down the refactoring hole. And oh boy did I fall _deep_.

First I returned to the `aotds-battle` sub-project -- the one implementing
the game rules. That game engine is basically a Redux store using
my own [Updux](https://www.npmjs.com/package/updux) framework to cut on the
boilerplate. From there I decided to do a full rewrite of `Updux` to iron
out the Typescript kinks of the original version. Well, that's a way to phrase
it that implies that I have some functional brain rudder. What actually
have happened is closer to an initial "Screw it, I'm going to rewrite it
without those bloody Typescript generics! JavaScript all the way, baby!",
followed a few days after by a "Come back, Typescript. All is forgiven, let's
start anew. Between you and I, we can make it work. _pleeease_"

Anyway, the short of it is that I'm well on my way to have a shiny new
functional rewrite of Updux.
The big difference with the previous version is that I'm
slacking off on the full-blown immutability pedantry, and stop trying to make
Typescript types perfect for all convoluted cases. Instead, I'm going for
making it easy to declare all Typescript needs when the Updux object is
created, and have the declarations of mutations come after to
leverage type checking and the such.

For example, here is what the current dux
(how I call one Updux instance, inspired by
[ducks](https://github.com/erikras/ducks-modular-redux)) for a ship, aka
bogey looks like:

```js
import u from 'updeep';
import { Updux } from 'updux';

import drive from './drive';
import weaponry from './weaponry';
import navigation from './navigation';

type Orders = {
	navigation?: {
		thrust: number;
		bank: number;
		turn: number;
	};
};

export const dux = new Updux({
	subduxes: { drive, weaponry, navigation },
	initial: {
		name: '',
		orders: {} as Orders,
	},
	actions: {
		setOrders: (bogeyId: string, orders: Orders) => ({ bogeyId, orders }),
	},
});

dux.setMutation('setOrders', ({ orders }) => u({ orders: u.constant(orders) }));

```

In that code snippet, when we create the dux, we define
its local initial state, the local actions it's using, and  
its _subduxes_ (i.e., internal duxes). The cool part is that
Updux will merge the local bits with the bits of the subduxes so that, for
example, when the full state of the dux is the merge of the local state plus
the state of all subduxes. The _wicked_ cool part is that -- thanks to
way too hairy generic gymnastics -- those are available to Typescript.

Wanna check out the type of the store state? Sure.

Want to check out the action generators, along their signatures? No problemo.

But the best is how those Typescript definitions are available for
`setMutation` and the like:

## Trouble in paradise

There are a wrinkle and a half in there, though.

The half wrinkle is how Updeep's succinctness can also makes it slightly
hermetic.

For example, I love how we can go from

```
dux.setMutation( 'increment', ({incr}) => state => ({
    ...state,
    counter: state.counter + incr
}) );
```

to

```
dux.setMutation( 'increment', ({incr}) => u({ counter: fp.add(incr) }) );
```

but I also realize how, for more complex mutations, it can make things more
dense than needed.

The other wrinkle, though, is worst. If you look at the previous
screenshot, you'll see that final `as any`. That's because `updeep`'s
Typescript signatures tries very hard to predict the update results based on
the arguments (I would know, I wrote them), but because Typescript is only
compile-time and `updeep` doesn't expect the output type to equal the input
type, it can only go so far.

But... there is another immutable library,
[Immer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/immer) that is specifically made to keep the input and output types in sync.
The previous version of Updux was already playing nicely with it, and with the
new version, well...
